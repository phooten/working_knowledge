# IMPORTANT NOTE
None of this code is mine. I might have implemented the solutions or taken
notes on the work, but it has all come from classes taken at Colorado Universtiy
during CS Masters courses.

Intention of this section is to consolodate work and create a single source for
notes and assignments I can reference in the future.
